Learing Java Script
===================

This project is my Java Script Learning log. I am following the text book `Eloquent JavaScript` by Marijn Haverbeke. Each chapter in this books comes with a set of exercises at the end. Here I am trying to solve them. Along with the programming solutions  I may discuss 
my understanding about the concepts and more reading in terms of hyperlinks.

Background
==========
I am a developer familiar with Java, Scala languages and Object oriented and Functional Programming, trying to extend my skills with other mainstream languages. 

Introduction
=============
* What is scripting language ?
  According to wikipedia, 'A scripting or script language is a programming language that supports scripts, programs written for a special run-time environment that automate the execution of tasks that could alternatively be executed one-by-one by a human operator'.
  They are often interpreted than compiled.

* Java Vs JavaScript ?
  'JavaScript, despite the name, is essentially unrelated to the Java programming language, although both have the common C syntax, and JavaScript copies many Java names and naming conventions. The language was originally named "LiveScript" but was renamed in a co-marketing deal between Netscape and Sun, in exchange for Netscape bundling Sun's Java runtime with their then-dominant browser. The key design principles within JavaScript are inherited from the Self and Scheme programming languages.' 

  Wiki: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript

* Functional Programming with JavaScript
  We can do functional programming with JavaScript, that doesn't mean that JavaScript is a functional language. Java script supports functions as first class citizens but lacks support many functional features like abstract data types, pattern matching etc. But here in this project am appraching problems with a functional mindset to the extend possible.

Running this project
====================
To Run the exercise in the project you need to install node js and Karma jasmine in your machine.

Install node js
===============
https://nodejs.org/en/download/

This will install `npm` (node package manager) too.

Now install Karma-Jasmine (Test runner and Test suite)
======================================================

$ npm install karma-jasmine@0.1.0 --save-dev

(Optional)Install node-repl 
===========================
This can be helpful if you want to try out JavaScript interactively.

$npm install node-repl -g

Online tutorials
================

There are a lot of online tutorials available for Java Script, am a great fan of online video tutorials and I find the following very useful.
